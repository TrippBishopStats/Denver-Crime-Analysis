# Denver Crime Analysis
## Summary
This project is an analysis of crime data for Denver Colorado that explores the use of kernel density estimation and hotspots to investigate criminal activity in Denver. The `Simple Features` 
package from the R ecosystem is used extensively for the geospatial code. The ecological fallacy is also explored in some detail. The data come from OpenStreetData and the Open Data Project.

### Additional Resources
In addition to the R code, all raw data and the database scripts required to create a basic PostGreSQL database are included to allow others to replicate my work or make further explorations 
of this relatively large dataset.
